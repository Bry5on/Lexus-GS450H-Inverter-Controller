# Lexus-GS450H-Inverter-Controller
Opensource controller for the Lexus GS450H Hybrid inverter and gearbox.
<br>
Controls the inverter using it's own OEM logic board. No modification required.
<br>
Connects to the gearbox and controls oil pump, gear shifting and temperature monitoring.
<br>
Only requires throttle and brake inputs from the vehicle but also has CAN capabilty for communicating with modern vehicles.
<br>
Big thanks to Tom Darby for figuring out the control protocol.
